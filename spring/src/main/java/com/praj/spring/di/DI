Dependency injection-

Dependency Injection is the ability of an object to supply dependencies of another object.

Client Class:
              This is the dependent class and is dependent on the Service class.

Service Class:
              This class provides a service to the client class.

Injector Class:
              This class is responsible for injecting the service class object into the client class


Constructor Injection:
             In this type of injection, the injector supplies dependency through the client class constructor.


Setter Injection / Property Injection:
            In this type of injection, the injector method injects the dependency to the setter method exposed by the client.


Interface Injection: In this type of injection, the injector uses Interface to provide dependency to the client class. The clients must implement
                    an interface that will expose a setter method which accepts the dependency.
